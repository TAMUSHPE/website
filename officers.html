This organization has provided me with numerous opportunities to develop as a confident student leader that hopes to inspire other Aggies to reach their goals both personally and in STEM. In my spare time you can find me at Aggie Football tailgates or serving it up on the tennis court! I am looking forward to a great year with all of you!</p>

A-WHOOP! This 2016-2017 academic year I will be serving as SHPE’s Director of Academic Development. My role as the Director of Academic Development is to host Monday Study Hours, host MentorSHPE Workshops, organize our Test Bank, and distribute the ScholarSHPE Newsletter. I joined the many other wonderful faces of SHPE the Spring of my freshmen year, and it was the best decision that I ever made throughout my time here at Texas A&M University. From attending MentorSHPE workshops to flying out of state for conference, I was able to grasp as much needed in order to assist myself in the development of my professionalism in the work field. I encourage all of you to take the opportunity to attend as many MentorSHPE Workshops as possible, as this will be your opportunity at developing yourself into a professional engineer. I look forward to getting to know every single one of you, and also at having an amazing year with TAMU SHPE! If you have any further questions about SHPE, or just need anyone to talk to about improving your academics, do not hesitate to contact me through any medium. As always, I look forward to having a great time with all you fellow SHPEsters! </p>

                    This is Juan Reyes, your Director of Public Relations for the 2016-2017 academic school year. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas while being the eldest of four boys. I am a first generation Aggie, however as they say “Texan by birth, Aggie by the grace of God.” There might be no one in the class of 2019 A-A-A-A-A, who is more red ass than yours truly. In all honesty, I am an easy going type of guy who is always willing to meet and greet our fine SHPEsters. No matter who you are SHPE will be an organization that can lead you onto a path to success. No matter the major or classification, come out to our events and gain valuable experience and relationships that may last you a lifetime. As your Public Relations Officer, I will be focused on planning our recruiting events, managing our facebook account and event invitations, as well as creating advertisements, coordinating t-shirt designs, and initializing our ice breakers during our meetings. My committee if you wish to join will be primarily dealing with public relations like work such as public speaking, event coordination, recruitment, and many other skills that we will develop throughout the school  year. Hope to see all of you SHPEsters this year and many more to come!!</p>
