                <h4>What is MentorSHPE</h4>

             <p>The MentorSHPE program was created in order to help develop SHPE aggies academically and professionally by pairing its participants to a mentor and/or mentee. Each underclassman will have an upperclassman student assigned to them as a mentor. Each upperclassman will have a mentee appointed to them, and will have the choice to have a professor or a professional from the industry as a mentor. Those interested in going to graduate school should pick the professor as the mentor while those that want to work immediately after graduating should pick the professional as the mentor.</p>

             <h4>What is the importance of MentorSHPE?</h4>

             <p>MentorSHPE is very important to SHPE because it helps guide its participants towards academic and professional success. With the help of a mentor, the mentees will be able to gain some direction towards what professors to take, advice for classes, and any other advice/recommendations on educational and professional choices.</p>
