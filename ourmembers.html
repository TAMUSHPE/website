                          Month</em></strong></h5>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                      I have been a member of SHPE since the first semester of my freshman year. After getting a
                      part-time job at the Study Abroad Office, personal struggles, and trying to adjust to the college,
                      I became inactive for a while until I was reintroduced to SHPE through my officer friends Kaylie
                      and Emmanuel. I can also say that other friendships I had with
                      active members/officers, like Adriana (my former mentor) and Luis, also encouraged me to join
                      because they were there for me in some way at some point.
                      I believe that an organization is only as great as the quality of the kindness of its members and
                      leaders, so that is why I think the TAMU SHPE Familia is the
                      best in the nation. It is also the reason why I am a member today.... I love how the foundation of
                      SHPE is selfless service. Many times recruiters come back to
                      A&M as an encouragement to current members and give back. The officers work tirelessly to provide
                      quality events when they are not even getting paid for the
                      equivalent of a part-time job. Members give of their time to support children and elders. College
                      seniors come to events during their last year in college,
                      which is very precious limited time. All of the smiles, greetings, conversations, and fun times
                      are acts of service from each member because each of those are
                      acts of kindness..” We are proud of Aubrey’s dedication to TAMU SHPE and are excited to see how
                      she will continue to impact our organization.

                      Howdy! Congratulations to our February Member of the Month winner, Anh Nguyen! Anh is a class of
                      2022 Environmental
                      Engineering major from Houston Texas. Anh is a very active member of our chapter and enjoys being
                      part of one of our Academic Committees.
                      “Well, [I got involved in SHPE when] my roommates invited me to go to one of the general meetings
                      and when I got there, I saw how friendly people were with one another,
                      jokes were being said from left and right. As a funny gal myself, I instantly felt at home. Not
                      long after,
                      I joined a committee and have been super involved. My favorite memory is attending my first
                      Eloteria Night, where I won Taboo.”
                      We are proud of Anh’s dedication to TAMU SHPE and are excited to see how she will continue to
                      impact our organization.

                      being part of our
                      External Affairs Committee. "The reason why I got involved in SHPE is that because of the warm
                      welcome they give
                      everyone! Everyone is welcomed with wide-open arms. This really made me be passionate about SHPE
                      because I wanted
                      to be that welcome party that either helps you navigate through Aggie land or is just there for
                      you when you need
                      help with anything!" We are proud of Eduardo’s dedication to TAMU SHPE and are excited to see how

                    <p class="card-text text-justify membermodal">
                      I joined TAMU SHPE in Fall 2016 of my freshman year after being recommended by a friend.
                      To me, being part of something greater than myself is incredibly fulfilling, so I attended as many
                      events as I could to soak it all in.
                      But despite the amazing workshops SHPE has to offer, it was the Familia that made me stay.
                      Becoming part of the SHPE Familia helped me
                      be well-rounded throughout my college career; I made several friends, valuable connections, and
                      even got to travel the nation (I left
                      Texas for the first time thanks to SHPE). I believe in the mission and vision of this organization
                      and look for any opportunity to
                      strengthen my community and inspire younger generations of minorities to pursue higher education
                      and STEM related fields. What I would
                      encourage all members, undergraduate or recent graduates, is to ask yourself: how did you get to
                      where you are today? Who were the people
                      that inspired you and mentored you to this day? Because in reality, you are that person for
                      someone else -- whether it be a friend, a sibling,
                      or even a stranger -- someone is looking up to you, so don’t let them down. Strive for success in
                      all that you do and never forget to give
                      back. We are a Familia and we care for one another. As a DACA recipient, I had an interesting
                      experience through college, so do not
                      hesitate to reach out to me if you are in a similar situation. I learned many valuable skills
                      after serving the chapter as President
                      my senior year that have now transferred to my current position where I work as an Engineering
                      Consultant. Finally, I am currently
                      on track to return this fall to begin my Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering and will
                      serve on the RLDC 2021 Committee,
                      so hopefully we will meet soon!

                    <p class="card-text text-justify membermodal">
                      I joined SHPE during my freshman year of college after going to SHPE &amp; Salsa during
                      Gig’em Week (or now Howdy week…). During the event, I remember talking to Saray
                      Martinez (President) and Paula Martinez (Secretary) and feeling so welcomed. I then
                      learned that there would be tortas for the next general meeting and was immediately sold.
                      As many say, I joined for the food and stayed for the people. It was through SHPE that I
                      met amazing people that motivated me to do better and were always willing to listen and
                      provide advice. I served as Director of External Affairs (2016-17) and as President (2017-
                      18). At first, I was hesitant to run for both positions, but I am glad I did. Both times
                      Gilberto Arizpe and Matthew Ramirez motivated me and believed in me, and I will
                      forever be thankful for that!
                      Being in those positions allowed me to develop professionally and learn skills such as
                      how to quickly resolve conflict, work with a team, and stand up for what I believe. It was
                      through SHPE that I was able to intern at Caterpillar and now work for Bechtel. SHPE
                      continues to be a part of my professional life both through SHPE Houston and within
                      Bechtel.
                      As for anyone that is looking to join SHPE, my advice is to do it! There are so many
                      ways to get involved, not just through the executive board. SHPE provides social and

                      professional events, so there is something for everyone out there. Most importantly, I
                      learned to believe in myself, which is my advice to anyone. Always believe in yourself,
                      and you’ll be surprised as to what you can achieve as long as you put your mind to it.

                      I joined SHPE my freshman year of college and never looked back! I quickly fell in love with the
                      desire
                      to ignite the passion for STEM in our younger generations and promote Latinas in STEM. SHPE
                      provided me
                      with a network of friends that were all going through the same struggles of navigating college as
                      a first
                      generation student as well as with the skills needed to succeed in the professional world. My
                      involvement
                      ranged from joining a committee as a freshman to holding various leadership positions and
                      ultimately being
                      the SHPE President my senior year. SHPE was critical for me to understand where I wanted to take
                      my
                      engineering career. I knew I wanted to be an engineer but I was not familiar with the different
                      industries
                      and kind of jobs engineers could have. Through my leadership experience I was able to land my
                      first co-op
                      experience with Cargill. I never had that shiny 4.0 gpa but I did have a well-rounded resume with
                      my
                      involvement that still had companies interested in what I had to say. As a professional I
                      currently serve
                      as the President of the South Carolina Professional Chapter and am able to connect with engineers
                      all over the state.
                      My advice for undergraduate students would be to PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE. For me that meant
                      breaking out of my shell
                      and learning how to first network with my peers and then professionals. Reach out to current
                      professionals in your
                      dream job, ask them the tough questions, ask them about their journey and where they see
                      themselves next. Be
                      courageous and do not be afraid to fail. Failure will come in the form of tests, project
                      executions
                      (in and outside of school) and after failure comes the next day. It’s important to have grit and
                      the will
                      power to keep going. It’s not an easy task and that’s why staying connected to your SHPE Familia
                      post
                      college matters. SHPE is an excellent organization for students but outside of college, things get
                      a
                      little fuzzy with the juggling of mental, physical, FINANCIAL and all other health’s we need to
                      keep
                      track of. I think once we get somewhat of a hand on all of that (it’s a life long journey tbh) we
                      need to be advocates for Latinx in STEM whether that’s in our own jobs or through the volunteer
                      work that we do as SHPE Professionals.

                      Picture this: you are a young and naive first generation college student wandering
                      the aisles of the MSC ballroom in hopes of finding an organization to be a part of. Your
                      attention is immediately brought to a white trifold with the words “Hispanic” and
                      “Engineer” plastered on it. Although nervous to meet someone new, you muster up the
                      courage to walk up to one of the officers and introduce yourself. You are handed a flyer
                      with the words “Free Food” bolded all over it. However, what you do not know is that
                      this flyer would be the key to unlocking your potential to becoming a better person,
                      academically, socially, and professionally. Sound familiar? Great. Then this too can be
                      you.
                      My journey with TAMU SHPE started with the story above. As a freshman, I was
                      only interested in the free food and playing in intramurals. It wasn’t until my sophomore
                      year when I decided to become more active that I realized how many opportunities SHPE
                      gives you to develop your individual skills. I was given a mentor by the name of Jorge
                      Acosta who advised me on what classes to take, how to study, and overall how to succeed
                      in my college career. More importantly, he was the person who introduced me to the

                      people in the organization that would always be there for you, AKA the SHPE Familia.
                      The SHPE Familia will teach you many things, from how to construct a resumé to giving
                      you the confidence needed to dance in front of your friends on a Saturday night. For
                      myself, the greatest opportunity I ever received was being elected as an officer my junior
                      year. This gave me the platform to inspire and advise new members in the same way that
                      those before me had done. In addition, it introduced me to a group of people that would
                      become my closest friends to this day. I was instantly hooked on SHPE and I knew this
                      was something I wanted to continue with once I graduated. I now serve as the treasurer
                      for the SHPE Austin professional chapter with the goal of leading young Hispanics in
                      their pursuit of degrees in STEM. My only advice to whomever is reading this is to never
                      be afraid to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. You never know if that leap of faith
                      you take in an organization could lead you on the greatest transformation of your life.

                      As a Hispanic woman, I was discouraged by my family to pursue an engineering degree which is why I
                      started out as a General Studies Major. At the start of my freshman year I decided to push the
                      negative
                      comments aside and pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My advisor at the time encouraged me
                      to join an engineering organization so that I could start meeting others in the engineering
                      community.
                      He spoke highly of SHPE and recommended I become a member as soon as possible.
                      As a freshman, I was intimidated to join such a large organization but gathered up the courage to
                      try it
                      out my sophomore year. As I walked in to the first general meeting of the year in the Scoates
                      building, I
                      was welcomed with open arms. The officers noticed I was new and sat down to talk to me before the
                      meeting started. The welcoming environment made me feel at home and encouraged me to become a
                      member. What sealed the deal were the delicious tortas. Tortas were traditionally served at first
                      general
                      meetings, a tradition I hope is still going on today! Soon after joining SHPE, I became involved
                      by
                      becoming an External Affairs committee member. The SHPE officers pointed out my potential and
                      encouraged me to run for a position in the leadership board. The rest became history! I became
                      secretary for two years and president my final year of undergrad.
                      The resources and opportunities SHPE provided me were invaluable. From general meetings to
                      professional development workshops, SHPE helped shape me into the professional I am today. Through
                      general meetings, I learned of all the opportunities available in engineering industry. I was able
                      to obtain
                      my first professional internship at The Boeing Company through SHPE. Overall, TAMU SHPE was a
                      great
                      support group through the challenging times and encouraged me to stay strong through adversity.
                      As minorities, there is a high probability we will encounter challenges at some point in our
                      careers.
                      Overcoming these challenges is an opportunity for growth and will only make us stronger. It is
                      essential
                      to have a strong support group (TAMU SHPE!!) that will challenge you and celebrate your wins. I
                      will
                      forever be grateful for the opportunities and memories SHPE provided. Most importantly, SHPE
                      gifted
                      me a Familia.

                      My SHPE journey began as a Freshman at SHPEs and Salsa, where I attended purely to
                      support my sister who was an officer at the time. What I didn’t know then, is that the
                      event welcomed me to a new family, my SHPE Familia. From that point on I became
                      heavily involved in intramurals, MentorSHPE, joined the Secretary Committee, and even
                      attended my first of four National Conventions. Moments like these shaped my college
                      career and influenced me to become Secretary during 2017-18 and later President during
                      2018-19, where our chapter won the SHPE National Large Chapter of the Year Award.
                      What first attracted me to SHPE, was the positivity and motivation that each member
                      shared. Being a first-generation student, I found comfort that most of the members were
                      just like me, a Hispanic student trying to make a name for themselves in an industry that
                      most people in our culture are unaware of. SHPE to me was a support system that was
                      there when your days were great but most importantly when your days were bad. With
                      this support, SHPE made me confident in myself and my crazy aspirations. In fact, it is
                      what lead me to apply to an internship with ExxonMobil, in which deep down, I felt
                      anxious and slightly underqualified for. Reflecting on it now, there is no way I begin my
                      career with a Fortune 3 company without SHPE. In total, SHPE allowed me to build my

                      professional network not just in Texas, but with members across the nation. It gave me
                      the soft skills to communicate efficiently with managerial personnel. And lastly, it gave
                      me the college friendships that will last a lifetime.
                      As some advice to undergraduates, make SHPE a part of your life whether big or small. I
                      firmly believe that SHPE is what you make of it, so reach outside of your comfort zone
                      and talk to an officer or someone who can guide you to getting the most out of SHPE.
                      Secondly, don’t attend SHPE events just for the points or for the free food (though it’s a
                      huge plus), attend because you want to learn a new skill, talk to company recruiter, or
                      help yourself grow as an individual. Finally, do not fear failure, rather fear not trying.
                      Apply for as many internships and full-time positions as you can, because you never
                      know which ones will come back with a life-changing opportunity for you and your
                      family!
