                              <!-- Texas A&M SHPE has its own SHPE Jr. Chapter located in Laredo, TX. The SHPE Jr. Program aims to augment the success of high school students by providing scholarships, mentors, tutors, and other resources to overcome persistent educational barriers and encourage students to pursue areas in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through AHETEMS, we are able to bring up thise and other high school students from different parts to come be part of a weekend long event we hold every year. The program is called Advancing Careers in Engineering (ACE) and we have different workshops we hold for the students to learn more about leadership and engineering.
