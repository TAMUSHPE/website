         <h4>What engineering track do I fall under?</h4>
         <p>Every engineering discipline is designated to a track. The importance of the track is geared more towards which ENGR 111/112 class you will be taking. Each of those classes is offered separately for each of the tracks. Usually, it is much easier to change engineering majors if you are in the same track after your first year. You can see the following tracks below.</p>

        <h2>Help With Classes</h2>
        <hr>

         <h4>Math Classes</h4>
         <p>Engineering requires taking a lot of math classes, especially if you were to get a math minor. Therefore, it is important that you take advantage of the math help sessions that are available for specific math classes which can be found on the main math website. Of course, your professors and tutoring outside of school are good resources too, but remember this is free! The math website is math.tamu.edu</p>

         <br>

         <h4>Tutoring</h4>

         <br>

         <h5>Professors</h5>

         <p>This is a good and free resource that should be taken advantage of! Although it may seem intimidating at first, it is always good to ask your professors for help because they get to see the effort you put into their class. Although it may not always happen, professors use that as a deciding factor for bumping a letter grade or simply helping you more as they see the amount of effort you put into understanding the material of the course.</p>

         <h5>Teacher Assistants (T.A.s)</h5>

         <p>Although not all classes have T.A.s, you will find that most of the biggest classes will have at least one. They are there not only to help professors grade papers, but also to help students with the course material. There will be many times that the professors will not be available and this is when T.A.s can become helpful as they may be more available than the professors. Going to them for help is free and it is highly encouraged to ask them for help.</p>

         <h5>Outside of School</h5>

         <p>There are many other resources outside of school that students take advantage of, but are costly. There are more tutoring locations for the bigger classes such as the more general classes that all engineers take. Some of those locations include “4.0” and “A+” among others. There are also private tutors who are seen advertised in billboards throughout the engineering buildings, so just make sure to keep an eye on the flyers that you see posted if you are interested.</p>

        <h2>Academic/Industry Experience</h2>
        <hr>

         <h4>Study Abroad</h4>
         <p>Studying abroad is a great opportunity to study in a different country for some time. It’s a good resume builder and the experience is unforgettable! Don’t be too scared to take the opportunity to travel while continuing your education. Many students regret not studying abroad so don’t make the same mistake!</p>

         <h5>How can I study abroad?</h5>

         <p>There are various ways that you could study abroad. You have a choice to take classes under your major (that information can be found in your major’s website). You can also take classes outside your major that could possibly be used as electives. To find out if those electives count towards your major’s curriculum, you would have to take to your academic advisor.</p>

         <p>You can also visit the Study Abroad Programs Office for more information:

         </p>


         <br>

         <h4>Internships</h4>

         <p>Getting an internship may be difficult when you are a freshman. However, it is still possible to get one! Having an internship is good experience to maturity and knowing how the “real world” works. It is also a good resume builder and good way to find out what you either like or dislike. Use your resources and visit the HireAggies website for more information and help for your internship search. Visit HireAggies.com for more information.</p>

         <br>

         <h4>Research</h4>

         <p>If you are interested in going to graduate school, research is the perfect opportunity to attain experience and fill your resume.There are many resources for finding research opportunities. Texas A&M University hosts research programs during the program, such as USRG and REU. For more information on the USRG programs, visit http://essap.tamu.edu/usrg/. There are also many research opportunities outside of Texas A&M University. To find an updated list of research programs available, visit http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/students/essc/reu. Another great resource (which can be found through the link above) is: http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.cfm?unitid=10006. This may be the most helpful as it has a nationwide list of all the research programs. If there are any opportunities available, then you can click on the link under the University name found to the leftmost side of the page.</p>

         <p>Other links for REU programs are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>http://www.orau.org/ornl/hereatornl/application.htm</li>
                <li>http://nees.org/education/for-students/reu-program</li>
                <li>http://peer.berkeley.edu/education/internships.html</li>
                <li>http://www.egr.uh.edu/reu/?e=application</li>
            </ul>
         </p>

         <p>Apart from all these programs, working for a professor during the year can also be an option. There are several programs here at A&M that encourage this, and thus help you find a job. It can be paid or unpaid depending on the program and professor. You can find other opportunities by visiting the study abroad office or study abroad website.</p>

         <br>

         <h4>Jobs</h4>

         <p>Many Texas A&M students need to work while going to school. Although it may be difficult to manage a job with classes, it is possible. It is recommended to find jobs that are related to your field of study. Anything else is still good experience but working with something related to your field will be more beneficial for building your resume. The job search intensifies upon graduation. Don’t wait too long and start looking for a job BEFORE you graduate. This increases your chances of getting a job and you don’t want to wait too long to find that you are job-less upon graduation. Once again, take advantage of resources and use the HireAggies website for your job and internship search.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Industrial & Systems Engineering</h2>
          <p>Industrial engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to the design, installation, improvement and control of integrated systems of people, materials, and facilities in a wide range or organizations that produce goods or render services. Like other engineering fields, industrial engineering is concerned with solving problems through the application of specialized knowledge in mathematics and science, as well as the principles of engineering. An important characteristic of industrial engineering is its system approach to integrate the basic resources of production and service systems and other relevant resources, such as information and energy, in such a way as to create a smooth, efficient and competitive operation within an enterprise. Industrial and systems engineers are needed in virtually all types of enterprises, ranging from industries such as manufacturing, distribution, logistics, transportation, and construction; service sectors such as health care, retail, banking, and engineering consulting to government agencies, military, and non-profit organizations.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mechanical Engineering</h2>
          <p>Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines, having culminated from the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Traditionally concerned with harnessing and converting energy forms, mechanical engineers are inherently multi-disciplinary. For example, the design of a car engine combines the fields of chemistry, thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, electronic controls, dynamics and vibrations, materials science, and mechanical design. Although the mechanical engineer may specialize in one of these fields, a cursory knowledge of each of these fields is necessary to interact with other engineers.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Nuclear Engineering</h2>
          <p>Nuclear engineering deals with the application and utilization of nuclear processes and radiations. The use of nuclear energy for the production of electrical power is a mature industry. Nuclear engineers work on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle and for many different types of employers such as government and private labs, regulatory agencies, reactor vendors, utilities and architect engineers. In addition, nuclear energy for space applications is a rapidly expanding field. Radionuclide technology in industry and medicine requires a large number of well-trained radiological health engineers.</p>

          <p>Ocean engineering is the application of engineering principles in an ocean environment. The diversity of this environment and the challenge of the ocean frontier make it an exciting career for young ocean engineers. Ocean engineering prepares people to build systems that monitor and control coastal environments. Students learn to build dikes, flood control systems, and power stations in or near the ocean. They also learn to use math and science to solve problems caused by tidal forces, waves, and currents.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Petroleum Engineering</h2>
          <p>Petroleum Engineering is primarily concerned with the economic extraction of oil, gas, and other natural resources form the earth. Producing oil and gas is accomplished through the design, drilling and operation of wells and well systems, and the integrated management of the underground reservoirs in which the resources are found. The goal of the TAMU petroleum engineering curriculum is to provide a modern engineering education with balance between fundamentals and practice, and to graduate engineers prepared for life-long learning but capable of being productive contributors immediately. Emphasis is on mathematics, computer applications, communication skills and interdisciplinary problem solving.</p>
